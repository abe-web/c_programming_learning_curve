# C Programming Language


## Goal list

[] -  Simple goal is to write code every day, if possible. 30 days straight in 2024. 

[] - Learn a language, in this case ANSI C, that will assist me in creating a more developer mindset. I'd also like to learn from videos, books likes PDF and physical manuals from the library. Basically, only free knowledge.

[] - Code with friends. I have Discord account that I've been turning on and sharing my screen as practice.

[] - Use Vim. Only to challenge myself in honing my skills to move around my text editor a lot faster. The arrow keys and mouse are slowing me down.

[] - When coding, take your time and learn. We are learning for function, not to turn in a homework assignment.

[] - Finally, build a web server and host an HTML file.

[] - Build a C compiler.
